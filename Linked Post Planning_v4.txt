## PHASE 1 SUMMARY

Phase: Foundation & Early Credibility
Status: COMPLETE

---

## PHASE 2: CORE TECHNICAL FOUNDATIONS

Post 5: CRC-Based Error Detection (IEEE 802.3)
Status: In Progress
Priority: HIGH
Target: Mid-April
Focus:

* Computer Networks fundamentals
* Error detection using CRC (binary polynomial division)
* Mapping theory → implementation (full workflow, not black box)
* Working with standards (IEEE 802.3)
* Sender-side frame construction
* Bit-level error injection & simulation
* Receiver-side verification

Implementation Showcase:
- CRC generation at sender
- Ethernet-like frame construction (payload + CRC)
- Simulated transmission errors (bit-flip injection)
- CRC verification at receiver
- Modular C design (crc.c, frame_builder.c, error_injector.c, io_handler.c)

Signal:
Demonstrates end-to-end understanding of data integrity in networks.
Not a tutorial—a real implementation with error simulation.

## PHASE 3: DEPTH & CRYPTOGRAPHY

Post 6: Learning Cryptography by Building AES
Status: In Progress
Priority: VERY HIGH
Target: End of Semester 4 (Late May)

Focus:

* AES encryption (limited, intentional scope)
* Validation using NIST test vectors
* Understanding security fundamentals deeply
* Correct use of AI for learning & documentation

NOTE:
This is the STRONGEST technical signal.
Do not rush. Do not dilute.

## PHASE 4: BUILD IN PUBLIC (ENGAGEMENT REPOST)

Post 7: Build in Public – External Repost
Status: PLANNED
Timing:

* Same day or next day after AES post
* Weekday (Tue–Thu)
* Evening IST

Post Type:

* Repost ONE external post only
* Add short personal caption

Caption:
Shipped code instead of polishing bullet points today.
Learning that consistent commits tell a clearer story than a resume.

## PHASE 5: OPTIONAL / PARKED PROJECTS

Post 8: Resume Helper — YAML-Driven Readiness System
Status: PARKED
Timeline: June or later (optional)

Hashtags (if posted):
#PromptEngineering #BuildInPublic

---

## PHASE 6: ANALYTICAL & META LEARNING (OPTIONAL)

Post 9: Prompt Engineering Mastery – Comparing AI Models by Prompt Quality
Status: OPTIONAL / PARKED
Timeline: After CRC + AES are live
Signal:

* Prompt optimization across vendors (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Gemini, etc.)
* Comparative testing methodology
* Building a reusable prompt comparison framework
* Real-world prompt performance benchmarking
* Non-hype evaluation based on data, not marketing

Concept:
Using the `model-agnostic-keywords` repository, build and publish a test harness that:
- Takes the same prompt → tests across 3-4 LLMs
- Measures output quality (correctness, consistency, token efficiency)
- Documents which keywords work best per vendor
- Shares results as open-source resource for developers

This positions you as someone who:
1. Understands prompt engineering deeply
2. Validates claims with data (not hype)
3. Contributes to the community (open-source)
4. Can optimize LLM workflows for quality & cost

Post 10: Prompting Basics – My Learnings
Status: OPTIONAL / PARKED
Timeline: Low academic load week
Signal:

* Structured thinking
* Transferable learning skill
* Clear articulation of process

---

## OPERATING RULES (STRICT)

* Do NOT delete the external repost links
* Repost ONLY ONE external post
* #BuildInPublic only when real execution exists
* No posting during application window (May–June 2026)
* CRC → AES order is fixed
* External repost only AFTER AES is live
* Use posts as evidence for:

  * Summer 2026 internships
  * Perplexity Program (June 2026)
