## Fourth Post: Prompting Basics – My Learnings
  1. Model-agnostic prompting keywords (work across most AI models)
     Role / Persona
     Task / Instruction
     Context
     Objective / Goal
     Constraints / Rules
     Examples
     Output format
     Tone / Style
     Step-by-step
     Explain like I’m a beginner
  
  2. Common prompting keywords used in all models
     Summarize
     Explain
     Compare
     List
     Generate
     Rewrite
     Translate
     Analyze
     Classify
  
  3. Technical terms commonly used across models
     Prompt
     Tokens
     Context window
     Completion / Response
     Temperature
     Top-p
     System prompt
     User prompt
  
  4. Prompt structure (simple and effective)
     Define the role
     Specify the task
     Provide context
     Set constraints
     Choose output format
  
  5. Zero-shot vs Few-shot prompting
     Zero-shot – No examples provided
     Few-shot – Examples included to guide output
  
  6. Iterative prompting
     Refining prompts through follow-up instructions
     Correcting or narrowing responses step by step
  
  7. Key limitations to remember
     Outputs may sound confident but be incorrect
     Verification is always required
     Vague prompts produce vague answers
  
  8. Key learning
     Prompt quality directly affects output quality.
     Prompting is a transferable, model-agnostic skill.
